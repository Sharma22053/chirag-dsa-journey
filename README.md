# Chirag's DSA Journey 

Welcome to my daily DSA grind! This repository is a collection of my solutions to coding problems — primarily from LeetCode for now — with plans to include problems from GFG and Codeforces in the future.

Why this repo?

- Strengthen problem-solving skills
- Build daily consistency
- Showcase learning progress for recruiters and peers
- Keep personal notes on approaches and edge cases
